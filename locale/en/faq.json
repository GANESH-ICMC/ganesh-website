	{"id":"q1", "question": "How do I join Ganesh?", "answer": "During the first semester of every year since the group started we realize what we call our \"Joining Process\", at which we teach the content that we consider as basic for different areas in information security. That way, new members can have a basic knowledge about hacking and get to know a little bit of each area so that they can know in which one they want to specialize in.\n Those classes, followed by practical challenges, usually last for three months and at the end of them the students that are interested can join the group.\n It is a requirement that members speak Portuguese since our meetings and most of our developed materials are in Portuguese."},
	{"id":"q3", "question": "Do I need to be a student at the University of SÃ£o Paulo to participate in the group?", "answer": "No! The group is not restricted to USP's students, but to be considered an official member and be able to have voting power on group decisions it is necessary to be associated to the university.\n If the person is not, it's still possible to join as a colaborator, which would allow them to participate in meetings, talks and competitions that the group participates or organizes."}, 
	{"id":"q4", "question": "Do I need to have previous knowledge to participate?", "answer": "No! It is only necessary to have access to a computer and, in case of remote classes, a stable internet connection so that you're able to participate. Everything else that is necessary will be taught during the Joining Process."}, 
	{"id":"q6", "question": "Do I need to be a student in a computer related major to be able to participate?", "answer": "No! Despite most members being in a Computer Science or Computer Engineering Major it is not mandatory that you are. We also have members that major in applied mathematics, electrical engineering and even other institutes such as the Institute of Physics."}, 
	{"id":"q8", "question": "What is the \"compromise term\" that I need to sign to join the group?", "answer": "It is a mandatory document for all group members. By signing it you agree that you won't cause damages to third parties using Ganesh's name and in the case that happens you should be responsible for the consequences without involving the group."}, 
	{"id":"q9", "question": "How much time do I need to spare to be able to participate in the group?", "answer": "The good news is that the more time you dedicate the more you'll learn! But to be a member doing the \"least\" possible we only require that you participate the general meetings, which are weekly and last an hour, and at least one area weekly meeting, which are usually two hours long, totaling the minimum of three hours."},
	{"id":"q10", "question": "How can I contact the group?", "answer": "You can do it either using the Contact page or through any of our social media @GaneshICMC."}
